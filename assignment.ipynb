Use the number of reviews for the last 12 months for each listing. To calculate the income per listing, multiply the price of each listing by the number of bookings you have calculated for the listing. Then, find the average of the income per listing for each city."

You may discuss with your colleagues in order to better understand the questions, if they are not clear enough, but you should not ask them to share their answers with you, or to help you by giving specific advice."
